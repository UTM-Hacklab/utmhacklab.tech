When you’re new to tech, it can feel like you’ve stumbled into a conversation where everyone knows what they’re talking about—except, of course, you.

Sometimes a short and simple explanation is all you need to get your head around a new concept.

## Web

### HTML <FaqSearch query="What is HTML?"/>

HyperText Markup Language is the document standard of the World Wide Web for creating web pages and web applications.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically.

_From [Glossary Tech](https://glossarytech.com/)_

### CSS <FaqSearch query="What is CSS?"/>

A stylesheet language that is used for presentation and formatting content on the web-pages, including font, size, color, spacing, border and location of HTML information.

_From [Glossary Tech](https://glossarytech.com/)_

### Javascript <FaqSearch query="What is Javascript?"/>

A client-side scripting language primarily used to make web pages interactive. In other words, it's responsible for the 'behavior' of a website, i.e. how HTML elements and CSS style animate and move around on the page.

### Node.js <FaqSearch query="What is Node.js?"/>

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.

### Vue.js <FaqSearch query="What is Vue.js?"/>

Vue.js is an open-source Model–View–Viewmodel JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.

### React.js <FaqSearch query="What is React.js?"/>

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.

### Angular <FaqSearch query="Angular framework"/>

A client-side JavaScript framework which is based on MVC architecture. It simplifies web development by offering automatic view/model synchronization.

### Semantic Markup <FaqSearch query="Semantic Markup"/>

Semantics refers to the correct interpretation of the meaning of a word or sentence.

To use a word semantically is to use it in a way that is properly aligned with the meaning of the word. When we misuse a word we are not using it semantically.

Many HTML tags have semantic meaning. That is, the element itself conveys some information about the type of content contained between the opening and closing tags.

## Data Science

### Bayesian Statistics <FaqSearch query="Bayesian Stats"/>

Bayesian statistics is a theory in the field of statistics based on the Bayesian interpretation of probability where probability expresses a degree of belief in an event.

_From [Glossary Tech](https://glossarytech.com/)_

### Big Data <FaqSearch query="Big Data"/>

A term that describes the large volume of data – both structured and unstructured – that inundates a business on a day-to-day basis. Can be analyzed for insights that lead to better decisions and strategic business moves.

_From [Glossary Tech](https://glossarytech.com/)_

### Computer Vision <FaqSearch query="Computer Vision"/>

Computer vision is a field of computer science that works on enabling computers to see, identify, and process images in the same way that human vision does, and then provide appropriate output.

_From [Glossary Tech](https://glossarytech.com/)_

### Convolutional Neural Network <FaqSearch query="ConvNet"/>

Convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.

They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, medical image analysis, and natural language processing.

_From [Glossary Tech](https://glossarytech.com/)_

### Data Structure <FaqSearch query="Data Structure"/>

A specialized format for organizing and storing data. Serves as the basis for abstract data types.

General data structure types include the array, the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on.

_From [Glossary Tech](https://glossarytech.com/)_

### Data Visualization <FaqSearch query="Data Visualization"/>

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data.

By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

_From [Glossary Tech](https://glossarytech.com/)_

### Hadoop <FaqSearch query="Hadoop"/>

An open-source software framework that is used for distributed storage and processing of big data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.

_From [Glossary Tech](https://glossarytech.com/)_

### Neural Networks <FaqSearch query="Neural Networks"/>

Neural networks(NN) are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input.

_From [Glossary Tech](https://glossarytech.com/)_

### Pattern Recognition <FaqSearch query="Pattern Recognition"/>

Pattern recognition is the process of recognizing patterns by using machine learning algorithm.

Pattern recognition can be defined as the classification of data based on knowledge already gained or on statistical information extracted from patterns and/or their representation.

_From [Glossary Tech](https://glossarytech.com/)_

### Random Forest <FaqSearch query="Random Forest"/>

Pattern recognition is the process of recognizing patterns by using machine learning algorithm.

Pattern recognition can be defined as the classification of data based on knowledge already gained or on statistical information extracted from patterns and/or their representation.

### Statistical Modeling <FaqSearch query="Statistical Modeling"/>

Statistical modeling is a simplified, mathematically-formalized way to approximate reality (i.e. what generates your data) and optionally to make predictions from this approximation.

The statistical model is the mathematical equation that is used.

_From [Glossary Tech](https://glossarytech.com/)_

### Time Series Analysis <FaqSearch query="Time series analysis "/>

Time series analysis is a statistical technique that deals with time series data, or trend analysis.

There are two main goals of time series analysis:

- Identifying the nature of the phenomenon represented by the sequence of observations
- Forecasting (predicting future values of the time series variable).

## Blockchain <FaqSearch query="Blockchain"/>

### Altcoin <FaqSearch query="Altcoin"/>

Altcoin is an abbreviation of “Bitcoin alternative”.

Currently, the majority of altcoins are forks of Bitcoin with usually minor changes to the proof of work (POW) algorithm of the Bitcoin blockchain.

The most prominent altcoin is Litecoin. Litecoin introduces changes to the original Bitcoin protocol such as decreased block generation time, increased maximum number of coins and different hashing algorithm.

### ASIC <FaqSearch query="ASIC Blockchain"/>

An “Application Specific Integrated Circuit” is a silicon chip specifically designed to do a single task.

In the case of Bitcoin, they are designed to process SHA-256 hashing problems to mine new bitcoins. ASICs are considered to be much more efficient than conventional hardware(CPUs, GPUs).

Using a regular computer for Bitcoin mining is seen as unprofitable and only results in higher electricity bills.

_From [Blockchain Hub](https://blockchainhub.net/blockchain-glossary/)_

### Bitcoin <FaqSearch query="Bitcoin"/>

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that:

- Runs on a global peer to peer network
- Is decentralised (no single entity can control it)
- Is open source
- Bypasses middlemen or central authority with no issuer or acquirer
- Anyone with a computer or smartphone can use it

_From [Blockchain Hub](https://blockchainhub.net/blockchain-glossary/)_

### Ethereum <FaqSearch query="Ethereum"/>

Ethereum is an open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables developers to write smart contracts and build and deploy decentralized applications(Dapps).

The native token of the blockchain is called Ether which is used to pay for transaction fees, miner rewards and other services on the network.

The main innovation of Ethereum is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) which runs on the Ethereum network and enables anyone to run any application. The EVM makes the process of developing blockchain applications much easier.

Before the emergence of Ethereum, developers had to develop a dedicated blockchain for each application they wanted to create. This process is time-consuming and resource-intensive.

As opposed to Bitcoin, its scripting language is Turing-complete and full-featured, expanding the kinds of smart contracts that it can support. The Ethereum project wants to “decentralize the web” by introducing four components as part of its roadmap:

- Static content publication
- Dynamic messages
- Trustless transactions
- An integrated user-interface
