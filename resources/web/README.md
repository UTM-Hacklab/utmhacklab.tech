# Web Development

## Website vs Web Application

### Website
A website is a page on the internet you can access through your browser. Websites are rendered in your browser using HTMl. You can style your HTML page using CSS as well as use JavaScript to give your page some functionality.

### Web Application
A web application is a type of website users can use to access and manipulate data. Web applications are built-on the idea of user interaction and are intended to provide a specific functionality for the user. Facebook, Gmail and Twitter are all examples of web applications.
