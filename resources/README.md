## Getting Motivated

It’s a wonderful feeling to be motivated about what you’re learning. Consuming entertaining digital content about your area of education can help you cultivate a sense of wonder.

::: tip Supplementing Course Content
Search these _edu-tainment_ channels for topics in your courses. They may not teach you how to pass a test, but they may help build an understanding of how what you're learning fits in.

### [PBS Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)

PBS makes Computer Science education accessible to people of all ages, and this crash course goes into a surprising amount of technical detail.

::: tip CS Education for everyone
I have often used this channel as a guide to provide context for when the content as its taught by professors becomes a bit too technical.

## Collaboration

### Visual Studio Code Live Share

It allows you to instantly (and securely) share your current project, and then as needed, share debugging sessions, terminal instances, localhost web apps, and more!
