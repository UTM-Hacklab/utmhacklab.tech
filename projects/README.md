# Projects

UTM's Hacklab provides space and guidance for students to work on projects. We encourage students to explore areas of technology that they are passionate about by building exploratory or implementation projects.

You can reach out to the student contributors via their emails on [Outlook](https://outlook.office365.com) or [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) involved in the project to see how you can get involved!

If you have a project you'd like featured, you can:

- Connect with a coordinator on our [digital community on Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com)

- Engage with us in person by visiting our office at UTM in Deerfield Hall Room 2014.
