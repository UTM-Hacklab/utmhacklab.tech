# How to contribute

The CSSC website is built using the Nuxt Framework. 

## Using components 

We have ready made components for you

Creating components so it's easy to reuse and for others to develop and contribute to the website (Under the components folder - Grid1x2, Grid1x3, etc.)

Every folder you make, it'll automatically generate a route for you (must have an index.vue file)

## Understanding Content

Content - you can make the content directory serve like a database (fetching JSON, CSV's, YAML, etc.)

asyncData - Grab content
Slug (the trailing portion after your domain) - It'll match everything under the top level
(A dynamic route matched)
