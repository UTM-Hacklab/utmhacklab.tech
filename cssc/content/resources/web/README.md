### What are Web Pages made of?

The content of a webpage is rendered using HTML. HTML is a markup language which means its purpose is to render information in the format you specified using HTML syntax.

These pages can be enhanced to look more user-friendly by adding color, frames and other aesthetic features using something called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

If you want give your page some functionality when users interact with it (such as by changing content on the click of a button), you generally use a programming language called Javascript that runs in the browser.

## Frontend Development

Frontend Development is the process of implementing user interfaces for web applications. As a frontend developer, you create the portion of the website that people interact with and ensure that the design requirements for how your application should 'look' and 'feel' are met.

## Backend Development

Backend Development is the process of developing the business logic and functionality of your tool.

As a backend developer, your responsibility is to write clean and scalable code which allows the transfer of data between the web browser and database server as per your application's description.

Usually, this involves working with databases to store data from users which is then extracted from the database and used in other parts of the application.

## What Web Development Tools Are There?

### Web Frameworks

A web framework is a tool that you could use as the skeleton for your application. It's helpful to use web frameworks because often, they have built-in features (such as user authentication capabilities) which you can use for development thus saving you time and increasing productivity.

Furthermore, frameworks are helpful when building larger applications because they are "scalable". This means you can easily implement features to your application in a way that follows a pattern such that other portions of your application are not impacted and your code is easily understandable if you want to make changes in the future. Frameworks are available for both backend and frontend development.

## Web Content Accessibility Guide 2.0 (WCAG 2.0)

Your web application is something that everyone should be able to use. Often, some of your users may require certain accesibility features on your web application so that they may experience the full benefits of your application. 

Many regions have requirements for web content accessibility as part of their legislation (such as Ontario as part of the AODA). Luckily, the W3 Consortium has published international guidelines on web content accessibility in what is know as 'WCAG 2.0'

<LevelWithButton desc="The WCAG2.0 is fairly extensive and provides a very comprehensive set of guidelines.
